# Guidelines

We take on the challenge of copying a black-box portfolio: we see only its periodic returns, not its actual holdings or weights. Using a wide range of liquid assetsâ€”stocks, bonds, ETFs, and futures and applying realistic limits on risk (1-month, 1% VaR) and trading costs (0.05% per trade), the project builds a synthetic portfolio whose returns match those of the hidden fund.
